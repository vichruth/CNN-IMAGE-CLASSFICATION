# CNN-IMAGE-CLASSFICATION

# 🧠 CNN-Based Image Classification

A deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into multiple categories. Built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a custom dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch for image classification. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of images and deployed using a simple web interface for predictions.
